## 🔍 Overview

## 🤔 How to Use the Focus Fox Timer
1. Customize the timer settings to fit your preferences.
2. Choose a task to focus on.
3. Start the Pomodoro timer and concentrate solely on your task for the set duration (default: 25 minutes).
4. Take a short break after each Pomodoro (default: 5 minutes).
5. After several Pomodoros, opt for a longer break (default: 15 minutes after every 4 cycles).
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all your tasks are completed.
